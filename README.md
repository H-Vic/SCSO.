# SCSO.
# Usage
It can be used for classification, prediction and other analysisã€‚

# Requirements
- Python 3.8 with packages matplotlib (3.7.3), numpy (1.24.3), pandas (1.4.4), installed
- Windows 11 

# Description of Files
-**SCSO** project consists of the following key Python files, each serving an important role in the implementation of the SCSO algorithm:
1.SCSO.py
  This file contains the primary implementation of the SCSO algorithm, handling the core functionalities such as initialization, iteration processes, and fitness evaluation.
2.Functions_details.py
 This script defines essential functions used throughout the algorithm, including objective functions and fitness evaluation procedures.
3.initialization.py
  Responsible for initializing the population and parameters required by the SCSO algorithm, ensuring a proper setup before the main optimization begins.
4.Main.py
  The main execution script that integrates all components of the SCSO algorithm, orchestrating the process flow from initialization to final result output.
  
-**Catboost Model** (*your Model.py*) :The CatBoost model code is widely available in various public repositories on GitHub, so we have not provided the code here. Users are encouraged to explore and integrate CatBoost from these sources. Additionally, you can replace the CatBoost model with other machine learning models and integrate them with the SCSO code for further customization and experimentation. 
- After installing the necessary python packages, users can directly run the *your Model.py* python script.
  
# Instructions 
1. Download the necessary project files, including stacking_Model.py, and place them in a dedicated folder within your file system.
2. Ensure that all required Python packages and libraries are installed. These may include scikit-learn, numpy, pandas, and any others listed in your project requirements.
3. Edit any configuration files (if applicable) to match your system's settings or paths. This could include specifying the data paths or project directories within the script.
4. Run stacking_Model.py in your Python environment. The script performs model compatibility using the predefined models and dataset. It can be executed directly in the Python command line. If the script takes arguments, ensure to specify the paths correctly.

e.g. **"python path_to_code/SCSO.py"**
